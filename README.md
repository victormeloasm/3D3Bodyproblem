# Three-body Problem Solver in 3D

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a solver for the Three-body problem in 3D. The Three-body problem is a classic problem in celestial mechanics that involves determining the motion of three objects interacting gravitationally with each other.

## About the Code

The code provided in this repository offers a numerical solution to the Three-body problem in three dimensions. It simulates the motion of three masses under the influence of gravitational forces and plots their trajectories.

The main file is `three_body_problem.m`, which contains the code for simulating the motion and plotting the trajectories. The code utilizes Newton's law of universal gravitation to calculate the gravitational forces acting on each mass and updates their positions and velocities accordingly.

## Usage

To use this code, you need MATLAB installed on your system. Follow the steps below to run the simulation:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned repository directory.
3. Open the `three_body_problem.m` file in MATLAB.
4. Modify the initial conditions and parameters if desired.
5. Run the script in MATLAB.

After running the script, the simulation will compute the trajectories of the three masses and plot them in a 3D graph. The resulting plot will display the motion of each mass over time.

Feel free to experiment with different initial conditions and parameters to observe different outcomes of the Three-body problem.
